## Introduction to this game:
  The Minesweeper Cricket Game is a web -based game that allows one or two players to play
a virtual cricket match. The game consists of a grid where players can click on cells to reveal
runs or fielders (like that of Minesweeper, but doesnâ€™t reveal surrounding cells and there are
no customizations of revealing number of fielders surrounding a cell). The objective is to score
maximum runs without clicking on the fielders. Getting out in this game is to click on a cell which
contains fielder (Similar to ball getting caught by a fielder in a real cricket game).

In the grid (Both in 6x6 and 7x7 grids), there will be 11 fielders randomly hidden in 11 cells
and runs in the remaining cells are also allotted randomly, ranging from 1 to 6.

In a single player mode, the aim of the player is to score as many runs as possible, and in the
two-player mode, aim of an individual player is getting a higher score than the other player.
